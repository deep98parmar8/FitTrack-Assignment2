# TrainFit

Train fit is an application where users can use to improve their training at the gym while also monitoring their diet.
Users can loginto the website and add their workouts as well as their nutrition,
Having that inputed users can make notes on how they felt and their mood in the gym. 
The main goal is to increase user motivation!


Problems I faced :
I had downloaded an api extention to produce an api key which kept crashing my visual studio.
Added foreign css which changed some file location when being pushed from github 
I tried implementing an api functionality to give Fitness news to the user in the app
App is connected to mongo db and deployed to heruko.
